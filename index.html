      <h1>What is the best frame material for bikepacking?</h1>
      <p>
Frame material is not nearly as important as people think, when it comes to selecting a bikepacking bike. That said, there are some caveats in particular user case scenarios and conditions.
      </p>
      <h2>Carbon</h2>
      <p>
Carbon fibre used to be an expensive exotic material to make bicycle frames with and was often out of the reach of everyone except pro cyclists. However, over the last couple of decades there has been rapid advancements in materials science leading to not only stronger carbon composites but much cheaper manufacturing processes.
      </p>
	          <h3>Benefits of carbon</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>lightweight</li>
    <li>stiff</li>
    <li>excellent strength to weight ratio</li>
    <li>non-corrosive</li>
    <li>good vibrasion dampening</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Aluminium</h2>

      <p>Aluminium used to be the most common frame material and still is in most areas of the World and is making somewhat of a resurgence of late. It is much easier to fabricate an aluminium frame at a lower weight and lower cost than steel. However because aluminium is less dense than steel, carbon and titanium the tubing on aluminium frames tends to be bigger and thicker.</p>
